                    <div class="accordion-body">The penalization of programmed obsolescence offers a real opportunity to assert consumer rights and protect the environment against these abusive practices. The offence makes it possible to sanction a practice that in the past could be qualified as a commercial strategy. Note that since the Hamon law, if an individual consumer does not have the means to initiate a procedure and collect the necessary evidence, an approved consumer association can do it for him.  This is why we want to refer a large community of consumers and collect data on cases of programmed obsolescence in order to eventually lead group actions in court.
                        The repression of this crime requires proof of the "deliberate" intention to reduce the life of the product "to increase the replacement rate".  While this may seem difficult to prove, it actually depends on the interpretation of the judges.

                    <div class="accordion-body">Programmed obsolescence was theorized by Bernard London in 1932 to boost an economic model that had run out of steam during the Great Depression. Economic growth is based on the stimulation of production and consumption. The more people consume, the more companies gain orders and invest to produce more, which theoretically increases employment and sales. VAT also relies on consumption, which leads the government to strongly encourage it in order to finance public spending. Our economic and social model is based on overconsumption, which must be constantly renewed. However, it is possible to imagine alternative economic models that do not rely on overproduction, as shown by some new or transitional businesses (rental, repair, reconditioning, sustainable manufacturers...).

                    <div class="accordion-body">After a first unsuccessful legislative proposal in 2013, the offence of programmed obsolescence was introduced in the Energy Transition Law in 2015.  Programmed obsolescence is now defined and punished by articles L441-2 and L454-6 of the Consumer Code. The law aimed at reducing the environmental footprint of the digital, enacted in November 2021, came to make the offense more easily applicable by removing part of the definition ("to increase the replacement rate"), which unnecessarily complicated it. The current definition is therefore :
                        Programmed obsolescence is defined as all techniques, including software, by which the marketer of a product aims to deliberately reduce its lifespan.
                        This offence is punishable by two years imprisonment and a fine of â‚¬300,000. The amount of the fine may be increased, in proportion to the benefits derived from the breach, to 5% of the average annual turnover, calculated on the last three annual turnovers known at the date of the facts.
                        The law of energy transition for green growth aims to improve the design of products by sanctioning programmed obsolescence. To learn more, visit the dedicated page of the website of the Ministry of Ecological Transition.

                    <div class="accordion-body">Many consumers have already experienced programmed obsolescence. In addition to penalizing the purchasing power of consumers, who are forced to change their appliances to buy new ones, programmed obsolescence generates a feeling of frustration and alienation. Programmed obsolescence is also the indirect cause of very difficult working conditions for subcontractors, especially in so-called "developing" countries. Indeed, the reduction in the life span of goods is accompanied by a reduction in production costs that weighs on employees. The production of certain objects such as telephones also gives rise to a struggle for resources that fuels social violence. Finally, programmed obsolescence promotes unsustainable consumption behaviors and institutionalizes every day a disposable culture.

It is about consuming and producing less, better, more local and ecological. If the end of programmed obsolescence would lead to changes in terms of employment, it would create new opportunities in other sectors. The European Commission estimates that the development of the circular economy could generate 170,000 additional jobs by 2030.
                        Thanks to the circular, collaborative, social and solidarity economy, it is possible to envisage new types of jobs in repair, services, sustainable development, local agriculture and many other sectors. At the same time, we need to engage in a global reflection on lifestyles, the exchange of goods and services, design, work and voluntary simplicity.

                        Aesthetic obsolescence, also called psychological or cultural obsolescence: by the "old-fashioned" effect, when the professional markets new products in a short period of time that are touted as more efficient in promotional campaigns (for example, a company already has new technological advances that it reserves for its next product that will be marketed only a few months later). Aesthetic obsolescence is more pernicious in the sense that it is mainly done through advertising and marketing and encourages people to renew products before they fail (but for example because they want a bigger screen, more fashionable clothes...).
                        Software obsolescence mainly concerns smartphones or laptop for example, but is increasing with the multiplication of connected objects. It covers several techniques: ; the limitation of the technical support duration compared to the real usage duration; or the incompatibility of format between old and new software version: the mandatory update which is too heavy and which makes the device slow down, causing dysfunctions and inciting to buy a product again.
